# PRODIGY_SD_02
A Java Swing–based Number Guessing Game that generates a random number and allows users to guess it through an interactive GUI. The application provides real-time feedback (too high/too low/correct), tracks attempts, validates input, and demonstrates event-driven programming with a clean, user-friendly design.
